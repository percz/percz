# Hi! 
When not communicating to humans, I mostly talk to computers in **C++** and love a bit of **JavaScript**. When in the library, I head to the **React** and **NodeJS**, and **Boost** shelves. 
I also tinker with electronics, and have designed fully custom circuit boards based around **STM32** and **ESP32** microprocessors.
I'm founder of Megazirt Ltd, and core member of the Norwich Hackspace.

If you want to know how I came to talk these languages, and design such electronics, you'll just need to ask me for my C.V. or checkout [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-childs-5147a567/).

## Personal Projects

Right now my personal *big-project* is [Batdar](https://batdar.co.uk). 
If you are checking that out before I finish it, you'll want to look for the secretive full stop under the logo for my latest build.
It's a site that produces heatmaps as a means of displaying the location and distribution of bat activity; the information is reported using STM32 devices I made that listen to the high-frequency bat calls and report over **LoRaWAN** to an **InfluxDB**. 
This information is then delivered to the client via **Websockets** in near real time.

In the past I also developed Datapoint-C++; a **C++** library for Met Office's open data API. This was developed for my private collection of Raspberry Pi nestbox boxes that I made and programmed to record the frequency of Blue Tit's visiting their nests, and comparing the data to weather patterns for statistical analysis in Grafana.

Mixing wildlife and technology seems to be my thing!

## Norwich Hackspace

When not chasing fluttering hamsters in the sky, I'm also to be found being a core-team member of [Norwich Hackspace](http://www.norwichhackspace.org/).
As well as abusively using the laser cutter, 3D printing yet another raspberry pi-case, and fixing some code for the CNC, I produce some code for member and public use under its banner.

The members communicate via Slack, for which I've developed (in **C++**) the *The Lion Bot* which boasts some natural language listening and uniquely added friendly responses. The Lion Bot records the chat activity to a database for statistics and allows some simple heating automation.

I've also co-developed *Pheasant* - An **React** app originally for a local emergency medical services charity. I've personally added the client-requested features of contact lists by geolocation, checklists flow and resource management.

Anyone notice the wildlife reference again?
